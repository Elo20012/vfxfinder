# VFXFinder

Welcome to the VFXFinder repository! VFXFinder is a platform designed to help you discover and explore live-action visual effects references and their breakdowns, making it easier to find inspiration for your own projects.

## Features

- Browse a collection of visual effects reference videos with breakdown.
- Search for specific VFX keywords (explosion, gravity, earthquake) or a movie name using the search bar.
- Add new videos to the collection using the [Google Forms](https://vfxfinder.com/add-video.html) (I will add them as soon as I can).
